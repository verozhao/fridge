Our product vision: Making fridge management smarter‚Äîso you waste less, save more, and eat better.

### üéØ Themes
- Optimizing space and food category: managing important details (ex. expiration date) without altering allocation of foods in fridge
- Recipie suggestions: suggesting possible recipies before throwing items away 
- Inventory analysis: reducing common failures and encouraging healthy roation in diet

## Project Overview
The Smart Refrigerator Management System (SRMS) is to tackle the issue of food waste caused by poor refrigerator management. With households wasting up to 40% of their food, SRMS aims to provide an intuitive solution for tracking food inventory, monitoring expiration dates, and offering smart storage recommendations tailored to different refrigerator models. The project has grown with contributions from students, researchers, and developers passionate about food sustainability and smart home technology.


## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from developers, designers, and food sustainability advocates! To get started:
- Read the following guidelines for to set up and run the project or review our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/agiledev-students-spring2025/4-final-smart-refrigerator-management-system/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on coding standards, issue reporting, and feature requests.
- Check open issues on our GitHub repository and comment on those you're interested in.
- Submit pull requests with well-documented code and commit messages.

## üöÄ Project Set Up
You can either set up manually or run everything with Docker containers.


## üõ†Ô∏è Local Manual Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system before continuing:

- **Node.js** (version 14+ or 16+ recommended)  
- **npm** (comes bundled with Node)
- **MongoDB Atlas Account** (for database)
- **Git** for version control  

**Check Versions**  
```bash
node -v
npm -v
git --version
```
---
### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/agiledev-students-spring2025/4-final-smart-refrigerator-management-system.git
cd 4-final-smart-refrigerator-management-system
```

---

### Front-End Setup (React)

2. Navigate into the front-end folder
```bash
cd front-end
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the front-end server
```bash
npm start
```

The app will open at: http://localhost:3000

---
### Back-End Setup (Express.js)

1. Open a new terminal tab or window

2. Navigate into the back-end folder
```bash
cd back-end
```
3. Edit .env file with your MongoDB Atlas connection string and JWT secret
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

5. Start the back-end server
```bash
npm start
```

The API will run at: http://localhost:5001

---
### Testing 
Navigate to the back-end folder and run:
```bash
cd back-end
npm test
```

- Testing with Mocha, Chai, Chai-HTTP

- Code coverage with c8

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions (DigitalOcean + Docker + CI/CD)

This application is deployed on a **DigitalOcean Droplet** and follows all production deployment best practices:

### - Live Production Deployment

APP URL: https://new-fridge-9qc4v.ondigitalocean.app/

Any changes pushed to the main branch are automatically deployed to our Digital Ocean droplet.


You can also clone and run the app **locally using Docker** as described below.

### - Dockerized Local Deployment

We containerized both the frontend and backend using Docker and orchestrated them with Docker Compose. This enables easy setup and development across all environments.

#### Prerequisites: 
- Docker
- Docker Compose

Make sure Docker is installed:
```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```
#### Setup Steps:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/agiledev-students-spring2025/4-final-smart-refrigerator-management-system.git
cd 4-final-smart-refrigerator-management-system
```

2. Run the application with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**Local Service Access:**
| Service | URL |
|--------|-----|
| Frontend (React) | http://localhost:3000 |
| Backend (Express API) | http://localhost:5001 |

‚úÖ Supports live code updates (React hot reload and backend Nodemon restarts).

### - CI/CD Setup
We implemented both Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment workflows using GitHub Actions.

‚úÖ CI Workflow: Runs tests on every branch push and pull request
![CI Build](https://github.com/agiledev-students-spring2025/4-final-smart-refrigerator-management-system/actions/workflows/continuous-integration.yml/badge.svg)

‚úÖ CD Workflow: Automatically deploys to DigitalOcean on push to main
![Deployment Status](https://github.com/agiledev-students-spring2025/4-final-smart-refrigerator-management-system/actions/workflows/continuous-deployment.yml/badge.svg)


## üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure
The application uses MongoDB with the following main collections:
- Users: Stores user accounts, preferences, and settings
- Items: Tracks food items in the refrigerator with expiration dates
- Recipes: Stores recipe data that can be recommended to users

## üåê API Endpoints

- POST /api/login: Log in a user
- GET /api/profile: Get the logged-in user's profile

### Items

- GET /api/items: Get all items for the logged-in user
- GET /api/items/:id: Get a specific item
- POST /api/items: Add a new item
- PUT /api/items/:id: Update an item
- DELETE /api/items/:id: Delete an item

### Recipes

- GET /api/recipes: Get all recipes
- GET /api/recipes/:id: Get a specific recipe
- GET /api/recipes/search: Search recipes
